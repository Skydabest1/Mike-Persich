<p>"Nourishing words encourages all to spiral upward, a consistent source of power, that brings health to spirits and souls of men" Jim Boerckel</p>

<p>For decades, Coach Persich has been the cornerstone of many different schools basketball programs, inspiring countless young athletes with his dedication, passion, and expertise. Coach Persich has not only led his teams to numerous championships but has also earned a distinguished array of awards and honors, recognizing his outstanding contributions to the sport and his commitment to nurturing talent. His coaching philosophy, centered around teamwork, discipline, and personal growth, has left an indelible mark on his players, many of whom have gone on to achieve great success both on and off the court.</p>

<p>Coach Persich wants to give back to his community and help old and new basketball players with practices in the Metamora Area. These fun practices will be based around shooting, communication, and tempo.</p>

<h3>Practice Information</h3>

<p>Nourishing words is for all players, reguardless of ability. Players that bring willingness to learn will bring out the best in both the player and the coach. Allowing both to thrive from practice.</p>

<p>A parent or guardian can reach Coach Persich between 5pm to 7pm at (309) 849-9019 to schedule practice. More information will be given at time of call.</p>

<p>A parent or guardian must be in attendace for the durration of the practice, as a second set of eyes will not only energize the performace, but it also holds the coach more accountable.</p>

<p>Tap Out Rule: Anytime a player is welcome to stop the workout</p>

<p>Back in 2010 one of his old players said in a Journal Star article, "It's fun to play for him, he's a good coach, a great person, and he knows basketball." Another senior, Zack Jacobs said "Whenever he says something, you want to pay attention and listen. But at the same time, he makes it fun."</p>
